In particular, this means:\n> * Lots of bugs. A lot of the scaffolding is still being ironed out. \n>   There are known safety issues, possible undefined behavior as well as other potential problems.\n> * Lots of missing features. The priority is to get basic interactions working;\n>   as such, edge case APIs are deliberately neglected at this stage.\n> * No stability guarantees. APIs will break frequently (for releases, we try to take SemVer seriously though).\n>   Resolving the above two points has currently more weight than a stable API.\nSo we do not recommend building a larger project in GDExtension-Rust yet.\nHowever, the library can serve as a playground for experimenting. \n\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Toolchain\n\nYou need to have LLVM installed to use `bindgen`, see [the book](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/getting-started/setup.html#llvm) for instructions.\n\nTo find a version of Godot 4, the library expects either an executable of name `godot4` in the PATH, or an environment variable `GODOT4_BIN`\ncontaining the path to the executable (including filename).\n\n### Project setup\n\nWe currently only have a GitHub version, crates.io releases are planned once more of the foundation is ready.  \nIn your Cargo.toml, add:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ngodot = { git = \"https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension\", branch = \"master\" }\n```\nTo get the latest changes, you can regularly run a `cargo update` (possibly breaking). Keep your `Cargo.lock` file under version control, so that it's easy to revert updates.\n\nTo register the GDExtension library with Godot, you need to create two files relative to your Godot project folder:\n\n1. First, add `res://MyExt.gdextension`, which is the equivalent of `.gdnlib` for GDNative.  \n   \n   The `[configuration]` section should be copied as-is.  \n   The `[libraries]` section should be updated to match the paths of your dynamic Rust libraries.\n    ```ini\n    [configuration]\n    entry_symbol = \"gdextension_rust_init\"\n    \n    [libraries]\n    linux.64 = \"res://../rust/target/debug/lib{my_ext}.so\"\n    windows.64 = \"res://../rust/target/debug/{my_ext}.dll\"\n    ```\n\n2. A second file `res://.godot/extension_list.cfg` simply lists the path to your first file:\n    ```\n    res://MyExt.gdextension\n    ```\n\n### Examples\n\nWe highly recommend to have a look at a working example in the `examples/dodge-the-creeps` directory.\nThis integrates a small game with Godot and has all the necessary steps set up.\n\nAPI documentation can be generated locally using `cargo doc -p godot --no-deps --open`.\n\nSupport for macOS is still ongoing, there is currently **no** support for Android, iOS or WASM.\nContributions in this regard are very welcome!\n\nIf you need help, join our [Discord] server and ask in the `#help` channel!\n\n\n## License\n\nWe use the [Mozilla Public License 2.0][mpl]. MPL tries to find a balance between permissive (MIT, Apache, Zlib) and copyleft licenses (GPL, LGPL).\n\nThe license provides a lot of freedom: you can use the library commercially and keep your own code closed-source,\ni.e. game development is not restricted. The main condition is that if you change godot-rust _itself_, you need to make \nthose changes available (and only those, no surrounding code).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nAt this stage, we appreciate if users experiment with the library, use it in small projects and report issues and bugs they encounter.\n\nIf you plan to make bigger contributions, make sure to discuss them in a GitHub issue first. Since the library is evolving quickly, this\navoids that multiple people work on the same thing or implement features in a way that doesn't work with other parts. Also don't hesitate\nto talk to the developers in the `#gdext-dev` channel on [Discord]!\n\n\n[Godot]: https://godotengine.org\n[`gdnative`]: https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust\n[mpl]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/\n[Discord]: https://discord.gg/aKUCJ8rJsc","contentHTML":"<p><img src=\"https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension/blob/master/assets/gdextension-ferris.png?raw=true\" alt=\"logo.png\" contenteditable=\"false\"><br></p><h1>Rust bindings for GDExtension</h1><p>This is an early-stage library to bind the <strong>Rust</strong> language to <strong>Godot 4</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>[Godot] is an open-source game engine, whose upcoming version 4.0 brings several improvements.</p><p>Its <em>GDExtension</em> API allows integrating third-party languages and libraries.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you are looking for a Rust binding for GDNative (Godot 3), checkout [<code data-backticks=\"1\">gdnative</code>].</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: this library is experimental and rapidly evolving.
